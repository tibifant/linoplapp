## Short and simple experimental text-to-speech algorithm

linoplapp turns IPA-notated text into speech (or at least it tries) by assembling a .wav file from snippets of the vocalized IPA-sounds.

- Input: (german) text in IPA-notation
- Output: vocalized text as .wav file

(Including short, fast and simple .wav writer.)
