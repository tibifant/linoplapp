## Short and simple experimental text-to-speech processor

This project experiments with turning IPA-notated text into speech (or at least something close to speech) by assembling a .wav file from snippets of the vocalized IPA-sounds of the inputed.

- Input: (german) text in IPA-notation
- Output: vocalized text as .wav file

(Including short, fast and simple .wav writer.)
